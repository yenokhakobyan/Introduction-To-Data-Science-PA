# Data Visualization in Python: Matplotlib and Plotly

## Overview of Data Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to reveal patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be obvious from raw data.  It is an **instrument for reasoning about quantitative information**.  Visual encoding (position, length, color, etc.) makes comparisons and anomalies immediately apparent.  Good visuals simplify complex data and speed decision-making by highlighting insights (e.g. a line chart makes trends over time clear).  Common goals include summarizing distributions, comparing categories, and exploring relationships.


## Chart Types and Use-Cases

* **Bar Chart (Categorical Comparison):** Displays counts or values as bars.  Use when comparing discrete groups (e.g. counts by category).  Bars can be vertical or horizontal; horizontal bars are useful when category labels are long.  *Variations:* stacked or grouped bar charts compare sub-groups.
* **Line Chart (Time Series / Trends):** Plots data points connected by lines.  Ideal for continuous or time-ordered data.  A rising or falling line highlights increases or decreases in the value.  Multiple lines can compare trends across groups.
* **Histogram (Distribution):** Similar to a bar chart but with **numeric bins**.  Each bar shows frequency (count) of values in a range.  Use for exploring the distribution (shape, spread, skewness) of a single numeric variable.
* **Scatter Plot (Bivariate Relationship):** Plots one variable on the x-axis and another on the y-axis, with each point representing an observation.  Use to examine correlation or patterns between two numeric variables.  Clustering, linear trends, or outliers become visible.
* **Box Plot (Distribution by Group):** Uses a “box and whiskers” to summarize a numeric variable’s distribution (median, quartiles, range) across groups.  Useful for comparing distributions between multiple categories.
* **Heatmap (Grid of Values):** Colors in a grid encode values for combinations of two variables.  Use when you have a matrix of values (e.g. correlation matrix or values over two dimensions).  Darker colors often mean higher values.  Heatmaps can replace scatter plots when there are too many points (aggregation by bin).
* **Pie/Donut Charts (Part-to-Whole):** Show proportions of a whole as slices.  Only use when the main message is “part-to-whole” (e.g. market share).  They are not good at precise comparison of values (hard to judge angles).  Use bar charts instead for exact comparisons.

Each chart type has strengths: e.g. line charts reveal trends, bar charts compare categories, and scatter plots reveal relationships.  The choice depends on data type (categorical vs. numerical) and the question (trend vs. distribution vs. comparison).

## Perception and Design Principles

* **Gestalt Principles:** The human visual system naturally groups elements.  Key principles include *proximity* (items close together appear related), *similarity* (similar color/shape cluster), *enclosure*, *continuity*, *closure*, and *symmetry*.  For example, placing similar-colored markers or grouping points in space implies they belong together.  Good visual design leverages these tendencies.
* **Tufte’s Data-Ink Maxim:** Minimize non-essential ink.  Keep only ink that represents data.  Remove gridlines, shadows, or decorations that don’t add information (often called **chartjunk**).  For instance, “maximize the data-ink and erase as much non-data-ink as possible”.
* **Avoid Chartjunk:** Do not add gratuitous 3D effects, backgrounds, or icons that distract.  Every element (color, line, text) should serve a purpose.  Excess embellishments slow comprehension.
* **Tufte’s Small Multiples:** When showing similar data over categories or time, use small consistent charts side-by-side to compare patterns (miniaturized repeated charts).

In practice, use clean layouts, high-contrast colors, and clear labels.  Favor simple color palettes (e.g. ColorBrewer schemes) and ensure text is legible.  Always label axes (with units), include a legend if needed, and add a concise title.

## Static vs. Interactive Visualization

* **Matplotlib (Static):** A classic Python library for creating publication-quality static plots.  It is highly customizable (fonts, layout) and integrates with LaTeX/math text.  Plots are “snapshots” – once rendered, you cannot interact with the data (pan, zoom, or hover) without additional tooling.
* **Plotly (Interactive):** A modern plotting library (often via Plotly Express) that creates interactive charts viewable in web browsers or Jupyter.  Plotly charts support **hover tooltips**, **zooming/panning**, and **click-to-hide traces**, greatly aiding data exploration.  For example, Plotly figures let you hover over a point to see its exact value or isolate categories by clicking the legend.  Plotly can also export to HTML for sharing.

Plotly Express provides high-level functions (`px.line`, `px.bar`, etc.) that mirror Matplotlib styles, so switching is straightforward.  Both libraries are well-maintained; choose Matplotlib for detailed static figures (e.g. for print) and Plotly for interactive dashboards or exploratory analysis.  Recent Python tooling even allows embedding static Matplotlib figures within interactive dashboards when needed.

## Tabular Data: Examples

### 1. Bar Chart (Matplotlib vs Plotly)

Let’s use a tabular dataset (e.g. the Titanic passenger data or Iris flower data) to compare category totals.  For illustration, assume we count samples in categories.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px

# Example with Matplotlib: Bar chart of categorical counts
categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
values = [23, 45, 12, 30]
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.bar(categories, values, color='skyblue')
plt.title("Category Counts")
plt.xlabel("Category")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
# The same with Plotly Express
fig = px.bar(x=categories, y=values, labels={'x':'Category','y':'Count'},
             title="Category Counts (Interactive)")
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* Each bar’s height encodes the count for that category.  In Matplotlib we set titles and labels manually; in Plotly we used `labels` and `title` arguments.  The Plotly version will be interactive: you can hover to see the exact value and the legend is clickable.  Try modifying the color palette (e.g. `color='salmon'`) or adding error bars.

### 2. Line Chart (Matplotlib vs Plotly)

Next, plot a numeric trend (e.g. time series or continuous data).

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Matplotlib line chart
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', color='teal', linestyle='-')
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("sin(X)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
# Plotly line chart
df = pd.DataFrame({'X': x, 'sin(X)': y})
fig = px.line(df, x='X', y='sin(X)', title="Sine Wave (Interactive)")
fig.update_traces(mode='markers+lines')
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* We plotted `sin(x)` using lines with markers.  In Matplotlib we explicitly set marker and line style; in Plotly, we used `mode='markers+lines'` to mimic this.  Matplotlib’s static plot shows the grid and labels.  With Plotly you can pan/zoom (Box Zoom) and hover to see values.  Students can experiment by adding a second line (e.g. `cos(x)`) or using `px.scatter` instead.

### 3. Scatter Plot (Matplotlib vs Plotly)

Now use a multivariate dataset (e.g. Iris) to plot points.  Scatter plots reveal clusters or correlations.

&#x20;*Figure:* Scatter plot of the Iris dataset (sepal length vs. sepal width). Each point is colored by species (setosa, versicolor, virginica), illustrating how Setosa (purple) is separable from the other two.

```python
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data[:, :2]  # use first two features
y = iris.target
target_names = iris.target_names

# Matplotlib scatter
plt.figure(figsize=(6,5))
for i, color in zip(range(3), ['purple','teal','gold']):
    idx = (y == i)
    plt.scatter(X[idx, 0], X[idx, 1], label=target_names[i], color=color)
plt.xlabel(iris.feature_names[0])
plt.ylabel(iris.feature_names[1])
plt.title("Iris: Sepal Length vs Width")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
# Plotly scatter
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=iris.feature_names[:2])
df['species'] = [target_names[i] for i in y]
fig = px.scatter(df, x=iris.feature_names[0], y=iris.feature_names[1],
                 color='species', title="Iris Scatter (Interactive)")
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* In the scatter plot, each point’s position encodes two features.  We colored points by species.  Matplotlib used a loop to plot each class; Plotly did it automatically via `color='species'`.  Note how Setosa (purple) clusters separately.  The Plotly chart is interactive: hover to see the exact (x,y) of a point.  (**Reflection:** Why might one prefer a scatter plot over a bar chart for this data? What if we added a third axis or used marker size to encode a third feature?)

### 4. Histogram and Box Plot (Matplotlib vs Plotly)

To examine distributions, use histograms and box plots.  Example with Iris sepal lengths:

```python
# Histogram of sepal length
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.hist(iris.data[:, 0], bins=15, color='gray', edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Distribution of Iris Sepal Length")
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length (cm)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
# Histogram with Plotly
fig = px.histogram(x=iris.data[:, 0], nbins=15, labels={'x':'Sepal Length (cm)'},
                   title="Iris Sepal Length Histogram (Interactive)")
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* The histogram bins the continuous sepal lengths.  We see how many flowers fall into each interval.  With Matplotlib we set `bins`; with Plotly we used `nbins`.  Hovering on the bars in the Plotly chart shows counts.

```python
# Box plot of sepal length by species
import seaborn as sns
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.boxplot(x=iris.target, y=iris.data[:,0], palette='Set2')
plt.xticks([0,1,2], target_names)
plt.xlabel("Species")
plt.ylabel("Sepal Length (cm)")
plt.title("Iris Sepal Length by Species")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
# Plotly box plot
df = pd.DataFrame({'Sepal Length': iris.data[:,0], 'Species': df['species']})
fig = px.box(df, x='Species', y='Sepal Length', title="Sepal Length by Species (Box Plot)")
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* The box plot summarizes medians and quartiles of sepal length for each species.  Note Setosa’s box is lower and tight, reflecting smaller, less variable sepal length.  Plotly’s box plot similarly allows zooming and hovering over quartile lines.  **Exercise:** Try changing the bin count in the histogram or adding `sns.violinplot` to compare distributions.

### 5. Heatmap (Matplotlib vs Plotly)

Heatmaps can display a matrix of values. For example, compute the correlation matrix of the Iris features:

```python
import numpy as np
corr = np.corrcoef(iris.data.T)  # correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', xticklabels=iris.feature_names[:4],
            yticklabels=iris.feature_names[:4])
plt.title("Feature Correlation Heatmap")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
fig = px.imshow(corr, x=iris.feature_names[:4], y=iris.feature_names[:4],
                color_continuous_scale='RdBu', title="Correlation Heatmap (Interactive)")
fig.update_layout(coloraxis_colorbar=dict(title="Correlation"))
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* Each cell’s color encodes the correlation between two features.  The diagonals are 1 (bright), off-diagonals show positive/negative correlations.  Matplotlib’s `sns.heatmap` added annotations.  Plotly’s `px.imshow` quickly creates an image heatmap with an interactive color scale.  (You can hover to see each correlation value.)  Heatmaps are **grids of values**.

## Text Data: Examples

Text data often must be quantified to plot. Two examples:

### 1. Word Frequency Bar Chart

Given a text (e.g. a document or tweets), we can plot word frequencies.

```python
from collections import Counter
text = "Data science is awesome. Python is powerful. Data and Python!"
words = [w.strip(".!?,").lower() for w in text.split()]
counts = Counter(words)
common = counts.most_common(5)
words, freqs = zip(*common)

plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
plt.bar(words, freqs, color='teal')
plt.title("Top Words Frequency")
plt.xlabel("Word")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(common, columns=['Word','Count'])
fig = px.bar(df, x='Word', y='Count', title="Word Frequency (Interactive)")
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* We tokenized a simple string, counted each word, and plotted the top words as a bar chart.  The Plotly chart again supports hover tooltips (e.g. mouse over a bar to see count).  **Question:** How would you modify the code to exclude common stop words (like “is”)? What happens if two words have the same frequency?

### 2. Sentiment Over Time (Line Chart)

For text streams (e.g. social media), one can compute sentiment scores over time.  For illustration, generate a mock time series of sentiment:

```python
import numpy as np
dates = pd.date_range("2023-01-01", periods=12, freq='M')
sentiment = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.3, size=len(dates)).cumsum()
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(dates, sentiment, marker='o', color='purple')
plt.title("Sentiment Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Sentiment Score")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```python
fig = px.line(x=dates, y=sentiment, title="Sentiment Over Time (Interactive)",
              labels={'x':'Date','y':'Sentiment'})
fig.show()
```

*Explanation:* This line chart shows how sentiment (positive/negative) changes over months.  Time is on the x-axis (rotated labels for readability).  In Plotly, the interactive chart lets the user zoom into any period.  **Exercise:** Replace `np.random.normal` with actual sentiment scores (if available) or change to a bar chart if you aggregate by quarter.

## Image Data: Examples

For image data (like MNIST digits or CIFAR), visualization often involves plotting example images or summarizing pixel statistics.

* **Displaying Sample Images:** Use `plt.imshow()` for a few images.  (Not shown here, but students can load e.g. MNIST and use `plt.subplot` to show digit images in a grid.)

* **Pixel-Intensity Histograms:** Treat image pixels as numeric values and plot histograms.  For example, flatten a grayscale image and plot its intensity distribution:

  ```python
  from skimage import data
  img = data.camera()  # example grayscale image
  plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
  plt.hist(img.ravel(), bins=256, color='gray', edgecolor='black')
  plt.title("Pixel Intensity Histogram (Grayscale)")
  plt.xlabel("Pixel value")
  plt.ylabel("Frequency")
  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()
  ```

  ```python
  # Plotly version
  fig = px.histogram(x=img.ravel(), nbins=50, title="Intensity Histogram (Interactive)")
  fig.update_layout(xaxis_title="Pixel value", yaxis_title="Frequency")
  fig.show()
  ```

  *Explanation:* This shows how many pixels have each grayscale value (0–255).  The shape often reflects the lighting and contrast of the image.  Using Plotly, you can hover over bars to see counts or select ranges.

* **Color Images:** For color images, you might plot separate histograms for R, G, B channels, or use a *heatmap overlay* of a grayscale channel on the image.

These examples show that even non-tabular data (text, images) can be visualized by summarizing them into numeric form.

## Customizing and Refining Plots

Both Matplotlib and Plotly allow extensive customization:

* **Titles and Axis Labels:** Always label axes and add titles/descriptions. In Matplotlib: `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`. In Plotly: use `title=` and `labels=` or `fig.update_layout(title_text='...')`.
* **Annotations:** You can annotate points with text. In Matplotlib: `plt.annotate(text, xy=(x,y))`. In Plotly: `fig.add_annotation()`. Use sparingly to highlight specific data points.
* **Legends:** Ensure legends are clear. In Matplotlib: `plt.legend()` after labeling plots. In Plotly, legends appear automatically when you use `color=` for categories.
* **Color Palettes:** Use consistent, colorblind-friendly palettes (e.g. `plt.cm.viridis`, Seaborn palettes, or Plotly’s built-in scales). Avoid using more colors than needed.
* **Subplots:** For multiple charts in one figure, use `plt.subplot()` or `plt.subplots()` in Matplotlib, or use Plotly’s `make_subplots` / facet maps (`px.histogram(..., facet_col='category')`).  Keep aspect ratios and spacing readable.
* **Grid and Style:** Matplotlib: `plt.grid(True)` can improve readability of numeric charts. Plotly: use `fig.update_layout(showlegend=True)`. Avoid heavy background styles.

By customizing, we enhance communication.  For example, a descriptive title and labeled axes ensure that a viewer immediately understands the message (e.g. “Average Score by Category, 2020–2024”).  Visual emphasis (color, bold text) can draw attention to key data.  **Reminder:** Always check the final figure in grayscale or for colorblind palettes to ensure accessibility.

## Static vs Interactive Comparison

| Aspect             | Static (Matplotlib)                         | Interactive (Plotly)                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interactivity**  | None (image only)                           | Hover tooltips, zoom, pan, click to toggle series |
| **Export**         | Save as PNG/SVG/PDF (fixed)                 | Export to HTML for web or static image            |
| **Complexity**     | Good for highly customized, precise control | Quick high-level plotting, less granular control  |
| **Learning Curve** | Longer (many functions/options)             | Simpler API (Express)                             |
| **Use Cases**      | Publication-quality figures; static reports | Exploratory data analysis; dashboards             |

Plotly’s interactivity can greatly aid exploration. For example, by hovering over the scatter in our Iris plot, one instantly sees the sepal measurements of each point.  Plotly supports exporting interactive HTML (via `fig.write_html`) so viewers can interact later.  Matplotlib figures are often used in papers or slide decks where interactivity is not needed.  In teaching, it’s useful to show both: static plots for sharing in documents, and interactive plots for in-class exploration.

## Best Practices for Effective Communication

* **Clarity First:** Ensure the visual has a clear message. Remove any non-essential element (consistent with Tufte’s advice).
* **Label Everything:** Axes should have units. Legends and colorbars should explain encodings. Titles should be brief but descriptive.
* **Color Use:** Use color to highlight data, not to decorate.  Use a fixed color scale for heatmaps to allow comparisons. For categorical data, use distinct hues with sufficient contrast.
* **Data-Ink Ratio:** Make the data stand out. Thin lines and light grids are fine, but avoid heavy 3D effects or backgrounds.
* **Consistency:** If showing multiple charts, keep scales consistent when comparing similar data. Align axes to aid comparison.
* **Avoid Misleading Practices:** Start bar charts at zero; be careful with log scales. Do not distort aspect ratio to exaggerate trends.
* **Narrative:** If the plot is part of a report, add a caption or explanation so the viewer knows what they are seeing and why it matters.

By following these principles and customizing plots thoughtfully, visualizations become clear, accurate, and compelling.

## Exercises and Reflection

1. **Matplotlib/Plotly Practice:** Using the Iris dataset, create a histogram of petal lengths with 20 bins. Customize the chart (title, labels) and experiment with at least two color palettes. *What differences do you observe?*
2. **Chart Selection:** Given a dataset of monthly sales for several stores, which chart type(s) would you use to (a) show overall sales trend over time, (b) compare sales across stores in a given month, and (c) show the distribution of sales values? Explain your choice.
3. **Interactive Features:** Take one of your Matplotlib charts and convert it to Plotly. Try adding a hover tooltip that shows additional information (e.g. exact values or category names). How does interactivity change your interpretation?
4. **Custom Annotation:** Modify the scatter plot code to annotate the outlier point (if any) with its index or value.  When is annotation useful, and when might it clutter the chart?
5. **Design Critique:** Examine a chart in the wild (news article or report). Identify any chartjunk or design issues (e.g. missing labels, confusing colors). How would you improve it according to the principles learned?
