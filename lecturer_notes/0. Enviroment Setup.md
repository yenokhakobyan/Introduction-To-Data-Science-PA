# 🐍 Setting Up Python Projects with venv, Jupyter, VS Code, PyCharm, Conda, and Git

---

## 📚 1. What is `venv`?

`venv` stands for **Virtual Environment**.

- It creates an **isolated Python environment**.
- Each project gets its own libraries without affecting system-wide Python.
- Prevents version conflicts between different projects.

> Think of `venv` like a *special box* where only the things your project needs live.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Creating and Using a `venv`

**Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- This creates a folder `venv/` containing a copy of Python and installed libraries.

**Step 2: Activate the Environment**

- **On Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **On Windows (CMD):**
  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **On Windows (Powershell):**
  ```ps1
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

You will see the terminal prompt change to something like:
```
(venv) your-folder $
```

Now, **you're working inside your project's environment**!

---

## 📦 3. Installing Packages and `requirements.txt`

Inside the active environment:

**Install libraries:**

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

**Freeze current environment into `requirements.txt`:**

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This file lists all installed libraries and versions.

**Later, to recreate the environment elsewhere:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📓 4. Working with Jupyter Notebook

**Step 1:** Install Jupyter inside your `venv`

```bash
pip install notebook ipykernel
```

**Step 2:** Add your `venv` as a Jupyter kernel

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Python (venv)"
```

- `--name` is the internal ID.
- `--display-name` is what you will see in the Notebook.

**Step 3:** Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then inside Jupyter, choose **Kernel > Change Kernel > Python (venv)**.

✅ Now Jupyter runs inside your virtual environment!

---

## 🖥 5. Using VS Code

**Step 1:** Install the Python extension for VS Code.

**Step 2:** Open your project folder.

**Step 3:** Select the interpreter:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → search `Python: Select Interpreter`
- Choose your `venv` from the list.

VS Code will automatically use the selected environment for running and debugging.

✅ Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code will also use your environment now!

---

## 🧠 6. Using PyCharm

**Step 1:** Open PyCharm → Open your project folder.

**Step 2:** Go to:
```
File → Settings → Project: your_project → Python Interpreter
```

**Step 3:** Click the gear icon → Add → Existing Environment

- Select `venv/bin/python` (Mac/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\python.exe` (Windows).

✅ PyCharm now uses your project-specific environment.

---
 
## 🧪 7. Using Conda (optional)

If you prefer `conda`, you can create a Conda environment instead of `venv`:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```

Install packages as usual:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

You can export the environment to a file:

```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```

And recreate it elsewhere:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

⚡ Conda is more powerful when you need heavy scientific libraries (like TensorFlow, PyTorch) easily installed.

---

## 🛠 8. Using Git with Your Project

**Best practices:**

- **Don't push your venv folder to GitHub** (it’s huge and unnecessary).
- Create a `.gitignore` file and add:

```
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```

- Always track your `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.

**Basic Git workflow:**

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
git push -u origin main
```

✅ This way, others can clone your repo and install everything easily using your requirements!

# 🚀 Quick Summary

| Tool             | Use Case                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `venv`           | Isolate Python packages            |
| `requirements.txt` | Record/install packages easily   |
| Jupyter Notebook | Run interactive Python notebooks   |
| VS Code          | Lightweight code editing & notebooks |
| PyCharm          | Full professional Python IDE       |
| Conda            | Manage heavy data science libraries |
| Git              | Version control for your project   |

---

# 📢 Final Tip:
**ALWAYS work inside a virtual environment** (venv or conda).  
It keeps your machine clean and your projects professional!

Would you also like me to prepare a tiny `.gitignore` and starter `README.md` template that you can just copy-paste into your course repo? 🚀
