# Ensemble Methods with Decision Trees: Comprehensive Learning Assignment

## Assignment Overview

Welcome to your comprehensive exploration of Ensemble Methods with Decision Trees! This assignment will take you on a remarkable journey through one of the most successful paradigms in machine learning. You'll discover how simple decision trees, which individually might seem limited or prone to overfitting, can be combined into extraordinarily powerful ensemble methods that consistently achieve top performance across diverse machine learning tasks.

The story of ensemble methods with trees is fundamentally about turning weaknesses into strengths. A single decision tree often suffers from high variance, meaning small changes in training data can lead to dramatically different trees and predictions. However, this apparent weakness becomes a superpower when we create many different trees and combine their predictions. The key insight is that while individual trees may make different mistakes, their errors often cancel out when averaged together, leading to more robust and accurate predictions.

Think of this like asking for directions in a new city. One person might give you excellent directions, but they could also be completely wrong or biased by their personal preferences. However, if you ask ten different people and follow the most common advice, you're much more likely to reach your destination successfully. This is the essence of ensemble methods: leveraging the wisdom of crowds to make better decisions than any individual could make alone.

Throughout this assignment, you'll explore three fundamental approaches to creating tree ensembles, each addressing different aspects of the bias-variance tradeoff. Bagging methods like Random Forest reduce variance by training multiple trees on different subsets of data and averaging their predictions. Boosting methods like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting reduce bias by sequentially training trees to correct the mistakes of previous trees. Stacking methods combine different types of models to leverage their complementary strengths.

What makes tree-based ensembles particularly fascinating is how they maintain many of the interpretability benefits of individual trees while dramatically improving predictive performance. You can still understand feature importance, analyze decision paths, and explain predictions to stakeholders, but now with the confidence that comes from robust, well-validated models.

**Learning Architecture:**
Your journey begins with manual calculations to build deep intuition about why ensemble methods work and how different combination strategies affect performance. You'll then implement core ensemble algorithms from scratch, understanding every component from bootstrap sampling to prediction aggregation. Next, you'll apply these methods to challenging real-world problems, experiencing their practical benefits and learning to navigate their limitations. Finally, you'll master advanced techniques like gradient boosting, ensemble selection, and modern optimization methods that represent the current state of the art.

## Part 1: Manual Ensemble Calculations - Building Deep Intuition (5 Questions)

Understanding ensemble methods begins with grasping the fundamental mathematical principles that make combining models more powerful than using them individually. These manual exercises will build the crucial intuition you need to understand why ensemble methods work and how different combination strategies affect the final predictions.

### Question 1: Understanding Variance Reduction through Averaging

Imagine you have trained three different decision trees on slightly different versions of a binary classification dataset. Each tree makes predictions with some accuracy, but also with some variability. You want to understand how combining their predictions affects both accuracy and stability.

**Individual Tree Predictions on Test Set:**
You have 10 test samples, and each tree predicts the probability that each sample belongs to the positive class:

| Sample | Tree 1 | Tree 2 | Tree 3 | True Label |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1      | 0.8    | 0.7    | 0.9    | 1          |
| 2      | 0.3    | 0.4    | 0.2    | 0          |
| 3      | 0.9    | 0.8    | 0.7    | 1          |
| 4      | 0.1    | 0.2    | 0.3    | 0          |
| 5      | 0.6    | 0.8    | 0.5    | 1          |
| 6      | 0.2    | 0.1    | 0.4    | 0          |
| 7      | 0.7    | 0.9    | 0.8    | 1          |
| 8      | 0.4    | 0.3    | 0.2    | 0          |
| 9      | 0.9    | 0.6    | 0.8    | 1          |
| 10     | 0.1    | 0.3    | 0.2    | 0          |

**Your Tasks:**
Calculate the ensemble predictions by averaging the three trees' probability outputs. Then convert to binary predictions using a 0.5 threshold. Compare the accuracy of each individual tree with the accuracy of the ensemble.

**Deep Analysis Questions:**
How does the ensemble's performance compare to each individual tree? Notice how the averaging process affects predictions that are close to the decision boundary versus those that are more confident. What does this tell you about when ensemble methods are most beneficial?

**Variance Analysis:**
For each test sample, calculate the variance of the three trees' predictions. Then calculate the variance of the ensemble predictions (which will be zero since we're averaging). Discuss how this variance reduction translates to more stable and reliable predictions.

**Space for your calculations:**

```python
# You can use this space to verify your manual calculations
# But work through the averaging and accuracy calculations by hand first!

```

### Question 2: Weighted Voting and Confidence-Based Combination

Now extend your analysis to consider that not all trees should contribute equally to the final prediction. Suppose Tree 1 has shown 85% accuracy on validation data, Tree 2 has 78% accuracy, and Tree 3 has 82% accuracy.

**Your Task:** 
Calculate weighted ensemble predictions where each tree's contribution is proportional to its validation accuracy. Compare this with the simple averaging approach from Question 1.

**Weighting Strategy Analysis:**
Experiment with different weighting schemes. Try accuracy-based weights, confidence-based weights (higher weights for more confident predictions), and inverse-error weights. Discuss the trade-offs between these approaches.

**Critical Thinking Challenge:**
When might weighted voting perform worse than simple averaging? Consider scenarios where the validation set used for weight calculation might not be representative of the test set, or where high-accuracy trees might be overconfident.

### Question 3: Bootstrap Sampling and Diversity Generation

Understanding how Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) creates diverse trees is crucial for grasping why Random Forest works so well. You'll manually work through the bootstrap sampling process to see how it generates different training sets.

**Original Training Dataset:**
You have a small dataset with 8 samples:

| Sample ID | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Class |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| A         | 2.1       | 1.5       | 0     |
| B         | 3.2       | 2.1       | 1     |
| C         | 1.8       | 3.0       | 0     |
| D         | 4.1       | 1.8       | 1     |
| E         | 2.5       | 2.8       | 0     |
| F         | 3.8       | 2.2       | 1     |
| G         | 1.9       | 1.9       | 0     |
| H         | 3.5       | 3.1       | 1     |

**Your Task:** 
Create three different bootstrap samples by randomly selecting 8 samples with replacement from the original dataset. Show how each bootstrap sample differs from the original and from each other.

**Analysis Questions:**
Calculate what percentage of the original samples appear in each bootstrap sample. How many samples appear multiple times? How many original samples are left out of each bootstrap sample? This analysis will help you understand why bootstrap sampling creates diversity.

**Out-of-Bag Analysis:**
For each bootstrap sample, identify which original samples were not selected (the out-of-bag samples). Explain how these out-of-bag samples can be used for validation without needing a separate validation set.

### Question 4: Sequential Error Correction in Boosting

Boosting works by sequentially training models to focus on the mistakes of previous models. You'll manually work through one iteration of the AdaBoost algorithm to understand how this error correction process works.

**Setup:**
You have 6 training samples, each initially with equal weight (1/6 ≈ 0.167):

| Sample | Feature | True Label | Initial Weight |
|--------|---------|------------|----------------|
| 1      | 0.2     | +1         | 0.167          |
| 2      | 0.4     | +1         | 0.167          |
| 3      | 0.6     | -1         | 0.167          |
| 4      | 0.8     | +1         | 0.167          |
| 5      | 1.0     | -1         | 0.167          |
| 6      | 1.2     | -1         | 0.167          |

Suppose your first weak learner (a simple decision stump) learns the rule: "Predict +1 if feature > 0.5, else predict -1."

**Your Tasks:**
Calculate the predictions of this weak learner for each sample. Determine which samples are misclassified. Calculate the weighted error rate of this weak learner.

Using the AdaBoost weight update formula, calculate the new weights for each sample for the next iteration. The formula increases weights for misclassified samples and decreases weights for correctly classified samples.

**Understanding the Process:**
Explain how the weight changes will affect the training of the next weak learner. Which samples will the next learner focus on, and why does this lead to better overall performance?

### Question 5: Bias-Variance Decomposition in Ensembles

This question helps you understand the theoretical foundation of why ensemble methods work by analyzing their effect on the bias-variance decomposition of prediction error.

**Theoretical Setup:**
Suppose you have trained 100 decision trees, each with a bias of 0.1 (meaning on average, each tree's predictions differ from the true values by 0.1) and a variance of 0.5 (meaning individual tree predictions vary significantly from their average prediction).

**Your Tasks:**
If the individual tree errors are uncorrelated, calculate the bias and variance of an ensemble that averages all 100 trees. Use the theoretical formulas:
- Ensemble Bias = Individual Tree Bias
- Ensemble Variance = Individual Tree Variance / Number of Trees

**Correlation Analysis:**
Now consider the realistic scenario where tree predictions are somewhat correlated. If the correlation coefficient between any two trees is 0.3, recalculate the ensemble variance using the formula:
Ensemble Variance = ρ × Individual Variance + (1-ρ) × Individual Variance / N
where ρ is the correlation coefficient and N is the number of trees.

**Practical Implications:**
Compare the variance reduction in the uncorrelated case versus the correlated case. Discuss why Random Forest introduces random feature selection – how does this relate to reducing correlation between trees? What are the practical implications for ensemble design?

                           int: specific number of features
        random_state: int, random seed
