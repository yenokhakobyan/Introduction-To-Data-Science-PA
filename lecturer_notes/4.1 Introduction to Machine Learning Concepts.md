# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computers **learn from data** to make predictions or decisions.  Unlike rule-based programming, ML systems use statistical patterns in data to improve performance on tasks over time.  Broadly speaking, ML is part of the data science pipeline: data scientists **gather, clean, and structure data**, and then apply ML algorithms to build predictive models.  For example, IBM notes that *“data science brings structure to big data while machine learning focuses on learning from the data itself”*.  In practice, ML models can **classify** items (assign them to categories) or **regress** (predict continuous values) based on historical data.

**Types of ML.**  Machine learning problems are typically categorized by the **form of feedback** available during training:

* **Supervised learning:** The model is trained on *labeled* data (inputs paired with known outputs).  Given features and the corresponding labels, the algorithm learns to predict the label for new inputs.  Common tasks include classification (discrete labels) and regression (continuous outputs).  For instance, predicting whether an email is “spam” or “not spam” is supervised classification, while estimating house prices is supervised regression.
* **Unsupervised learning:** The model works on *unlabeled* data, seeking to uncover inherent patterns or structure.  Without target labels, the algorithm might cluster similar data points or reduce dimensionality.  For example, customer data with no predefined groups may be clustered to identify market segments.  Unsupervised methods are often used for exploratory analysis, anomaly detection, or preprocessing data.
* **Reinforcement learning:** An agent interacts with an environment and learns by trial-and-error feedback.  The agent takes actions, observes rewards or penalties, and adjusts its strategy to maximize cumulative reward.  For example, a self-driving car can be trained via reinforcement learning: the “agent” observes sensor inputs (speed, distance to obstacles), takes actions (steer, brake), and receives rewards for staying safe and penalties for collisions.

These categories cover the mainstream ML paradigms.  (Other settings like semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and deep learning extend these ideas.)  In sum, ML provides algorithms that *learn from examples* rather than following explicit programmed rules.

**Machine Learning within Data Science.**  Data science is the broader field that combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data.  Machine learning is one of its key tools.  In IBM’s words, data science uses tools to process raw data and develop insights, and then *“machine learning focuses on learning from what the data science comes up with”*.  In practice, a data science project may involve collecting data, cleaning it, exploring patterns, and finally training an ML model to make predictions.  Thus, ML can be seen as a specialized step in data science: it takes structured data and automatically identifies patterns to solve problems.

# Common Use Cases of Machine Learning

Machine learning is widely used across industries and in everyday technology.  Here are some illustrative examples:

* **Recommendation systems:** Websites like Amazon, Netflix, or Spotify use ML to suggest products, movies, or music based on user preferences.  These systems analyze past behavior (such as browsing history or purchase history) and find patterns to predict what a user might like.  For example, *“recommendation engines at sites like Amazon, Netflix and StitchFix make recommendations based on a user’s taste, browsing and shopping cart history”*.  In marketing, ML also personalizes advertisements and email campaigns by identifying offerings likely to interest each user.
* **E-commerce and marketing:** Retailers and online services use ML to analyze customer data for targeted marketing.  For instance, if a user leaves items in a shopping cart or exits a website, ML models can predict which users are most likely to return and what offers might bring them back.  ML algorithms can also optimize online ads by analyzing click-through rates and customer feedback in real time.
* **Customer service and chatbots:** ML powers intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants in customer support.  Natural Language Processing (NLP) models classify customer queries and route them to appropriate responses.  As IBM notes, *“voice-based queries use natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis”* for speech recognition, and chatbots can answer questions around the clock.  For example, businesses use ML-driven virtual agents on websites to immediately answer customer questions, handling many queries simultaneously without waiting times.
* **Voice assistants:** Systems like Amazon Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google Assistant rely heavily on machine learning.  When you speak to these devices, ML models perform speech recognition and language understanding to interpret your request.  As IBM describes: *“It’s ML that powers the tasks done by virtual personal assistants or voice assistants… when someone asks a virtual assistant a question, ML searches for the answer or recalls similar questions”*.
* **Fraud detection:** Financial institutions and insurance companies use ML to detect fraudulent transactions.  By training on historical data of legitimate and fraudulent activity, ML models learn patterns of fraud.  For example, *“machine learning-based fraud detection systems rely on ML algorithms that can be trained with historical data on past fraudulent or legitimate activities to autonomously identify the characteristic patterns of these events”*.  Such systems flag unusual transactions (anomalies) for further review, helping to reduce losses from fraud.
* **Healthcare diagnostics and management:** ML has many applications in healthcare.  In medical imaging, ML models (often deep learning) assist in diagnosing diseases from X-rays or MRIs.  In health records, ML can sift through Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to extract relevant information.  According to industry sources, ML can *“quickly scan EHRs for specific patient data, schedule appointments with patients and automate a range of procedures”*.  ML is also used for predicting patient risk factors, personalizing treatment plans, and accelerating drug discovery.
* **Other examples:** ML powers many other everyday technologies: facial recognition in smartphone cameras, spam and email filtering, self-driving cars (which combine ML and reinforcement learning to navigate), and predictive maintenance in manufacturing (scheduling repairs before equipment fails).  In social media, ML analyzes trends and can even estimate user churn to help companies retain customers.

These examples show that ML is pervasive: wherever large data is available, ML algorithms can detect patterns and make predictions to improve decisions and automation.

# Key Concepts and Terminology in Machine Learning

## Machine Learning

**Definition:** Machine learning (ML) is “a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions”. In other words, ML enables computers to improve their performance on a task by learning patterns from data rather than relying on fixed rules.

**Intuition:** Think of ML as giving a computer many examples and letting it figure out a general rule. For instance, an email spam filter can “learn” from a set of labeled emails which words or patterns indicate spam, so it can later predict whether new, unlabeled emails are spam.

**Example:** A classic example is image recognition. A machine learning model can be trained on thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. It will learn features (like shapes, textures, or colors) that distinguish these animals. Once trained, the model can classify new images: if you show it a picture of an unknown animal, it predicts “cat” or “dog” based on what it learned.

## Supervised Learning

**Definition:** In *supervised learning*, a model is trained on **labeled** data: each input comes with a correct output (label). Formally, supervised learning is “a paradigm where a model is trained using input objects (e.g. feature vectors) and desired output values (also known as a supervisory signal), which are often human-made labels”. The goal is to learn a function that maps new inputs to outputs.

**Intuition:** Imagine teaching a student with flashcards. You show the student a picture of an animal (input) and tell them “this is a cat” (label). After seeing many such examples, the student learns to recognize cats and can label new, unseen pictures. The training process adjusts the model so that its predictions match the known labels.

**Example:** Email spam classification is a supervised learning task. Each email (input) is labeled as “spam” or “not spam”. The learning algorithm uses this labeled training data to build a model. Later, given a new email, the model predicts its label (spam/not spam) based on patterns it learned (like certain keywords). Another example is house price prediction: the inputs are features of houses (size, location, etc.) and labels are known sale prices; the model learns to predict the price of a new house.

## Unsupervised Learning

**Definition:** *Unsupervised learning* involves training on **unlabeled** data, where no explicit output labels are provided. The model must find structure or patterns in the input data on its own. Put formally: “Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input”.

**Intuition:** This is like giving the student a mixed bag of objects and asking them to group similar ones together without any guidance. The student might group objects by color or shape based on inherent similarities.

**Example:** A common unsupervised task is clustering. For instance, an e-commerce site might have data on customer behavior (items viewed, purchase amounts) without knowing customer categories. An unsupervised algorithm can cluster customers into segments with similar behavior (e.g., “bargain hunters” vs. “big spenders”) even though no segment labels were given. Another example is anomaly detection: the model learns the normal pattern of data (e.g. network traffic) and can flag anything that looks different, without ever being told what “normal” or “abnormal” is.

## Features and Labels

**Definitions:** A **feature** is an individual measurable property or characteristic of the data; formally, “a feature in machine learning refers to an individual measurable characteristic or property of an object that is being observed”. In tabular data, features are typically the columns (e.g., age, height, income). A **label** (or target) is the ground truth output we want the model to predict; “a label is a description that informs an ML model what a particular data represents”. In supervised learning, the label is the correct answer (output) for each training example.

**Intuition:** Think of features as the input ingredients that describe each example, and the label as the answer you’re trying to predict. For example, if you have data on houses, features could be “square footage”, “number of bedrooms”, “neighborhood”, etc., and the label could be “house price”.

**Example:** In an image classification task to identify dogs vs. cats, features might include pixel intensities, color histograms, or detected edges, and the label is “dog” or “cat”. In another example, a spam filter’s features could be word counts or presence of certain keywords in an email, and the label is 1 for spam or 0 for not-spam.

## Model

**Definition:** A **machine learning model** is a mathematical representation learned from data. Formally, “a machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, once ‘trained’ on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model’s internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions”.

**Intuition:** The model is like a function or set of rules that we discover during training. In simple linear regression, the model might be $y = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b$ where the weights $w_1, w_2$ and bias $b$ are learned from data. After training, these parameters are fixed, and we use them to predict $y$ for new $x$.

**Example:** A decision tree model learns a set of “if-else” rules from the training data. For instance, a tree that diagnoses illness might learn rules like “if fever > 38°C and cough present, then flu; otherwise, maybe allergy.” The internal structure (nodes and splits) is determined during training. Another example is a neural network model, which has many weights; after training on image-label pairs, those weights are set so the network maps input images to correct labels.

## Training and Testing Data

**Definitions:** The **training data** is the dataset used to fit the model’s parameters. In supervised learning, it consists of input-output pairs; each training example has features and the corresponding label. The **test data** (or hold-out set) is a separate dataset used to evaluate the model after training. According to theory, “the model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights…) of the model”. The **test data set** provides an unbiased evaluation of the final model’s performance: “Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set”.

**Intuition:** You train on the training data (with known answers), and then test on new, unseen data to check if your model can generalize. This is like studying flashcards (training) and then answering a quiz with new questions (testing).

**Example:** Suppose you have 10,000 labeled movie reviews for sentiment (positive/negative). You might use 8,000 for training the sentiment model and set aside 2,000 as test reviews. After training, you run the model on these 2,000 unseen reviews and compare its predictions to the true labels to see how accurate it is.

## Overfitting and Underfitting

**Definitions:** **Overfitting** occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations rather than the underlying pattern. It “corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably”. In contrast, **underfitting** happens when a model is too simple to capture the data’s structure. The Wikipedia definition states: “Underfitting occurs when a mathematical model cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. … For example, underfitting would occur when fitting a linear model to nonlinear data”.

&#x20;The figure above illustrates overfitting in terms of training vs. validation error. The blue curve is the training error, which keeps decreasing as training continues. The red curve is the validation error on held-out data: it initially decreases but then starts increasing at point “!,” indicating overfitting (the model is too specialized to the training data). Underfitting (not shown) would correspond to both curves being high because the model is too simple (e.g. fitting a straight line to parabolic data).

**Intuition:** If a model is too **complex** (e.g. a very high-degree polynomial), it can “memorize” the training examples, achieving almost zero training error but failing on new data (overfitting). If a model is too **simple** (e.g. a straight line on nonlinear data), it won’t even do well on the training data (underfitting) and will also perform poorly on new data. The sweet spot is a balance between the two.

**Examples:**

* Overfitting example: Fitting a 10th-degree polynomial to 10 points that actually lie roughly on a quadratic. The high-degree polynomial will wiggle to hit every point exactly, but on new points it will give large errors (it has learned the “noise” in those 10 points).
* Underfitting example: Using linear regression to model data that clearly has a curved trend. The linear model will miss the curvature and have large errors even on training data.

## Bias–Variance Tradeoff

**Definition:** The **bias–variance tradeoff** describes how model complexity affects errors on training vs. unseen data. In statistics/ML terms, it “describes the relationship between a model’s complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data”. Bias is error due to incorrect assumptions (models that are too simple), while variance is error due to sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set (models that are too complex). A concise explanation is that **bias** corresponds to underfitting and **variance** to overfitting.

**Intuition:** As you increase a model’s flexibility (e.g. more parameters), the training error (bias) usually decreases since the model can fit the data better. But after a point, the model starts fitting noise and its predictions on new data become erratic (variance increases). The tradeoff is finding a model that is complex enough to capture the real patterns but simple enough to generalize.

**Key Points:**

* **High bias (underfitting):** Model is too simple; misses patterns. Low training accuracy, poor generalization.
* **High variance (overfitting):** Model is too flexible; learns noise. Very high training accuracy, but poor test accuracy.
* **Tradeoff:** Techniques like regularization (see below) or choosing the right model complexity aim to balance bias and variance for best generalization.

## Cross-Validation

**Definition:** Cross-validation is a model evaluation technique for assessing how well a model will generalize to independent data. It “splits the data into several parts, trains the model on some parts and tests it on the remaining part, repeating this process multiple times. Finally the results from each validation step are averaged to produce a more accurate estimate of the model’s performance”.

**Intuition:** Instead of a single train/test split, cross-validation (like *k*-fold CV) rotates which subset is used for testing. This uses the data more efficiently and gives a better estimate of performance. It helps prevent overfitting in model evaluation by ensuring every data point is used for both training and testing at some point.

**Example:** In **k-fold cross-validation** (common choice is k=5 or 10), the dataset is divided into k equal parts. We do k rounds of training: each round uses k–1 parts as training data and the remaining part as the validation set. We then average the performance (e.g. accuracy) across the k rounds. For instance, in 5-fold CV we train on 80% of data and test on 20%, five times with different splits, then average the results.

**Other Types:**

* *Hold-out validation:* Simple split (e.g. 70% train / 30% test once). Quick but can suffer from high variance if the split is unlucky.
* *Leave-One-Out (LOOCV):* A special case of k-fold where k equals the number of data points. Each round uses all but one sample for training and the one sample for testing. Very low bias but can be very slow and high variance.

## Confusion Matrix

**Definition:** A confusion matrix (error matrix) is a table used to summarize the performance of a classification model. For a binary classifier, it has two rows (actual classes) and two columns (predicted classes). Each cell counts how many instances fall into each actual/predicted category. It makes it easy to compute various performance metrics.

**Structure:** For a binary problem (Positive vs. Negative class), the matrix is:

|                     | Predicted Positive   | Predicted Negative   |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Actual Positive** | True Positives (TP)  | False Negatives (FN) |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positives (FP) | True Negatives (TN)  |

* **True Positive (TP):** Correctly predicted positive cases.
* **False Positive (FP):** Incorrectly predicted positive (actual was negative).
* **True Negative (TN):** Correctly predicted negative cases.
* **False Negative (FN):** Incorrectly predicted negative (actual was positive).

**Example:** Suppose we have 100 patients, 80 with disease (Positive) and 20 healthy (Negative). A test predicts 75 correctly as diseased (TP=75), misses 5 diseased (FN=5), and wrongly labels 3 healthy as diseased (FP=3), with 17 healthy correctly labeled (TN=17). The confusion matrix helps compute metrics below.

## Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

These are metrics derived from the confusion matrix:

* **Accuracy:** Proportion of all correct predictions. Mathematically,

  $$
    \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}.
  $$

  (From \[85], Accuracy = $\frac{TP+TN}{P+N}$). Accuracy can be misleading on imbalanced data (e.g. 95% accuracy when one class dominates).

* **Precision:** Also called Positive Predictive Value, it is “the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances”. Formula:

  $$
    \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}.
  $$

  It measures how many of the predicted positives are actually positive.

* **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):** Fraction of actual positives correctly identified. Formula:

  $$
    \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}.
  $$

  It measures how many of the actual positive cases the model found.

* **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the two. Formula (for two-class):

  $$
    F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
        = \frac{2\,TP}{2\,TP + FP + FN}.
  $$

  (As shown in \[85], $F1 = \frac{2\,TP}{2\,TP + FP + FN}$). A high F1 means both precision and recall are high.

**Example:** In the patient test example above (TP=75, FN=5, FP=3, TN=17),

* Accuracy = (75+17)/100 = 92%.
* Precision = 75/(75+3) ≈ 0.962 (96.2%).
* Recall = 75/(75+5) = 0.9375 (93.75%).
* F1 ≈ 2\*(0.962\*0.9375)/(0.962+0.9375) ≈ 0.949.

## Loss Function and Cost Function

**Definitions:** A *loss function* quantifies the error of a model’s predictions for a single example; a *cost function* (also called objective function) is an aggregate (often the average) of the loss over the training set. In ML, a loss function measures “the deviation of a model’s predictions from the correct, ground truth predictions”. During training, we adjust model parameters to minimize this loss. The IBM article notes “loss function” is often synonymous with “cost function” when minimization is the training objective.

**Intuition:** Think of a loss as a penalty for each mistake. For example, if you predict a house price of \$210k but the true price is \$200k, the loss measures that \$10k error. Summing or averaging this over all houses gives the cost. The learning algorithm tries to minimize the cost by tuning parameters.

**Examples:**

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Common for regression. For a single example with true value $y$ and prediction $\hat y$, $L = (y - \hat y)^2$. The cost is usually $ \frac{1}{N}\sum (y_i - \hat y_i)^2$.
* **Cross-Entropy (Log Loss):** Common for classification. For binary classification, if $y$ is 0/1 and $p$ is the predicted probability of class 1, $L = -[y\log(p) + (1-y)\log(1-p)]$. For multi-class, use the general cross-entropy formula.

Adding a loss to the learning algorithm guides it: the model updates itself (e.g. via gradient descent) to reduce this value.

## Hyperparameters vs. Parameters

**Definitions:** In ML models, **parameters** are internal values learned from training data (e.g. weights and biases in a neural network). **Hyperparameters** are external configurations set *before* training that control the learning process. Formally, “in machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter that can be set in order to define any configurable part of a model’s learning process … these are named hyper parameters in contrast to parameters, which are characteristics that the model learns from the data”.

**Intuition:** If training the model is like cooking, parameters are the ingredients measured (and adjusted) by the training process, whereas hyperparameters are the recipe settings you choose beforehand (like learning rate, number of layers, regularization strength, etc.).

**Examples:**

* Model parameters: For linear regression $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b$, the weights $w_1,w_2$ and bias $b$ are parameters learned from data. In a decision tree, the structure and split values are found during training (implicitly the “parameters”).
* Hyperparameters: Learning rate (step size) for gradient descent, number of epochs, number of hidden layers in a neural net, regularization coefficient ($\lambda$ in L1/L2 regularization), tree depth limit, etc., are chosen before training. They are often tuned via cross-validation.

## Gradient Descent

**Definition:** Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a differentiable function. It’s “a first-order iterative algorithm for minimizing a differentiable multivariate function”. In ML, we usually apply it to minimize the cost/loss function with respect to model parameters. At each iteration, we update the parameters by moving in the direction opposite to the gradient (the steepest descent direction).

**Intuition:** Picture yourself on a hilly landscape (error surface) and trying to descend to the lowest point. You look around, find the steepest downhill direction (the negative gradient), take a small step that way, and repeat. Eventually, you (hopefully) reach a valley (minimum error). This process is gradient descent.

**Example (Gradient Descent step):** If $\theta$ represents model parameters and $J(\theta)$ the cost, the update rule is $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \gamma \nabla_\theta J(\theta)$, where $\gamma$ is the learning rate.

```python
# Example: simple gradient descent for a linear model y = w*x (no bias)
import numpy as np

X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=float)
Y = np.array([3, 6, 9, 12], dtype=float)  # true relationship: y = 3x
w = 0.0          # initial weight
lr = 0.01        # learning rate
for i in range(100):
    # Prediction: y_pred = w * x
    preds = w * X
    # Compute gradient of MSE loss = (1/N)*sum((pred - Y)^2)
    grad = (2/len(X)) * np.dot((preds - Y), X)
    # Update weight
    w -= lr * grad

print("Learned w:", w)
```

This code uses gradient descent to learn $w$. After training, `w` will approach 3, the slope of the true relationship $y=3x$.

## Regularization (L1 and L2)

**Definition:** Regularization refers to techniques that add a penalty to the loss function to discourage overly complex models and prevent overfitting. For linear models, **L1 regularization** adds the sum of absolute weights to the cost, and **L2 regularization** (ridge) adds the sum of squared weights. Formally, a regularized cost might look like $\min_\theta \sum_i L(f_\theta(x_i),y_i) + \lambda R(\theta)$, where $R(\theta)$ is a penalty on parameters (e.g. $\|\theta\|_1$ or $\|\theta\|_2^2$).

**Intuition:** By penalizing large weights, regularization biases the model toward simpler solutions. L1 (lasso) tends to make many weights exactly zero (sparse model), while L2 (ridge) shrinks all weights but usually none to zero. This helps models generalize better by not relying on any single input feature too heavily.

**Examples:**

* **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Adds $\lambda \sum_{j} w_j^2$ to the loss. Encourages small, evenly distributed weights. In linear regression, the cost becomes $J(w) = \sum (y_i - \hat y_i)^2 + \lambda \sum w_j^2$.
* **L1 Regularization (LASSO):** Adds $\lambda \sum_{j} |w_j|$ to the loss. This often results in many $w_j = 0$, effectively selecting a subset of features.
  According to theory, “L1 regularization (also called LASSO) leads to sparse models by adding a penalty based on the absolute value of coefficients. L2 regularization (also called ridge regression) encourages smaller, more evenly distributed weights by adding a penalty based on the square of the coefficients”.

**Key Point:** The hyperparameter $\lambda$ controls the strength of regularization. A larger $\lambda$ increases bias (potentially causing underfitting) but reduces variance (mitigating overfitting). Finding the right $\lambda$ is done via techniques like cross-validation.

**Figure:** An illustrative overfitting plot (training vs. validation error) is shown above【80†】, demonstrating why such penalties are useful: without regularization, the model might follow the training error curve (blue) down forever, but the validation error (red) goes up. Regularization would flatten the model, stopping at a better-generalizing point.

**Note:** Other regularization methods include **dropout** (in neural networks) and **early stopping**, but L1/L2 are the most fundamental penalties on model parameters.

**Sources:** Authoritative definitions and explanations have been provided by Wikipedia and expert articles. These provide formal definitions and context for the concepts above.


# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

The **k-nearest neighbors (KNN)** algorithm is a classic, simple ML method for classification (and regression). It is a **non-parametric, instance-based** algorithm. In KNN, the model makes predictions for a new input by looking at its “neighbors” in the training data: it finds the *k* closest training points (according to some distance metric) and then **votes** on their labels (for classification) or **averages** their values (for regression).  KNN makes **no strong assumptions** about the data distribution, and in fact there is no explicit training phase – it simply stores all the labeled training examples and waits until a prediction is needed.

## Intuition Behind KNN

The intuition of KNN is that **similar instances have similar labels**.  A new data point is likely to belong to the same class as its nearest neighbors.  For example, suppose you have two classes (blue squares and red triangles) plotted in feature space, and a new point (green) arrives.  KNN will look at the closest points around that green query point and take a majority vote of their classes.

&#x20;*Illustration: KNN classification example with k=3.* In this diagram, a new query point (green circle) is surrounded by training points of two classes (red triangles and blue squares).  The algorithm identifies the three nearest neighbors of the query (circled) and sees two red triangles and one blue square. By majority voting, the green point is classified as belonging to the red-triangle class. This simple procedure embodies KNN: “an object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors,” assigning it the most common class among its *k* nearest neighbors.

In other words, KNN assumes that points close in feature space are likely to share the same label.  It is sometimes called a **lazy learner** because it does not build a general internal model in advance; all work (distance computations and voting) happens at prediction time. This makes KNN easy to understand and implement, although predictions can be slow for large datasets.

## Distance Metrics (Mathematical Formulation)

A key component of KNN is the **distance metric** that defines “closeness.”  For continuous numeric features, the most common choice is the **Euclidean distance**: for two points \$x=(x\_1,\dots,x\_n)\$ and \$y=(y\_1,\dots,y\_n)\$ in \$n\$ dimensions,

$$
d_\text{Euclid}(x,y) \;=\; \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}\,. 
$$

Often this is written as \$|x-y|\_2\$.  Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between points in feature space.  For some data, other metrics can be used (for example, Manhattan (L1) distance or Minkowski distance).  In classification tasks with discrete or categorical data, a different measure like the Hamming distance or overlap metric might be used.  For example, in text classification the *Hamming distance* counts how many words differ between documents.  The Wikipedia KNN article notes that *“a commonly used distance metric for continuous variables is Euclidean distance. For discrete variables… another metric can be used, such as … Hamming distance”*.

Once a distance is defined, the **KNN algorithm** proceeds as follows:

1. **Choose k and metric:** Select a value of \$k\$ (the number of neighbors to consider) and a distance metric (e.g. Euclidean). Larger \$k\$ makes the model less sensitive to noise but can blur class boundaries.
2. **Compute distances:** For a new query point \$x\$, compute its distance to each point \$X\_i\$ in the training set: \$d(x, X\_i)\$.
3. **Find nearest neighbors:** Sort the training points by distance and identify the *k* closest ones.
4. **Aggregate neighbors’ labels:**

   * For **classification**, take a majority vote of the \$k\$ neighbors’ class labels.  The query is assigned the class that appears most frequently among the neighbors.
   * For **regression**, compute the average (or optionally a distance-weighted average) of the neighbors’ numeric values. Weighted versions weight each neighbor by \$1/d\$ or similar.

Mathematically, if the sorted neighbors are \$(X\_{(1)},Y\_{(1)}),\dots,(X\_{(k)},Y\_{(k)})\$ (ordered by increasing distance to \$x\$), then the predicted class is \$\arg\max\_{c} \sum\_{j=1}^k \mathbb{1}{Y\_{(j)}=c}\$ (the class with most votes).

In summary, KNN makes predictions by **looking up the closest examples** in its memory of past data.  All computation is deferred to prediction time, which is why it is called an *instance-based* or lazy learning method.

## Step-by-Step Example

To illustrate KNN concretely, here is a brief pseudocode of the algorithm for classification (using Euclidean distance):

```
Given: training set {(X_i, y_i)}, new point x, number k
1. For each training example (X_i, y_i), compute d_i = distance(x, X_i).
2. Sort all training examples by d_i, ascending.
3. Take the first k examples after sorting; let their labels be L = [y_(1), ..., y_(k)].
4. Prediction: y_pred = most_common_label(L).  (Choose the label that appears most in L.)
```

This procedure is summarized in the literature: *“Compute the Euclidean (or Mahalanobis) distance from the query example to the labeled examples; order them by increasing distance; find the k nearest neighbors… and (for regression) calculate an inverse-distance weighted average”*.  For classification, the last step becomes a simple majority vote of the neighbors’ classes.

## Python Implementation

Below is a simple Python example of KNN for classification. First we show a **manual implementation** (from scratch) using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

def euclidean_distance(a, b):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((a - b)**2))

def knn_predict(x, X_train, y_train, k=3):
    # Compute distances from x to all training points
    distances = [euclidean_distance(x, xi) for xi in X_train]
    # Sort by distance and take indices of k nearest
    idx = np.argsort(distances)[:k]
    # Majority vote among neighbors
    neighbor_labels = [y_train[i] for i in idx]
    return max(set(neighbor_labels), key=neighbor_labels.count)

# Example training data (1D for simplicity)
X_train = np.array([[0], [1], [2], [3]])
y_train = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])   # Labels: 0 for first two, 1 for last two
x_test = np.array([1.5])

print(knn_predict(x_test, X_train, y_train, k=3))  # Outputs 1
```

In this code, we define a function to compute Euclidean distance and then find the *k* nearest training points. For a test point at 1.5, the three nearest neighbors are at 1, 2, and 3 with labels \[0, 1, 1], so the majority vote is class 1.

In practice, it is more convenient to use a library.  Here is the same KNN classification using **scikit-learn**:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
import numpy as np

# Training data
X_train = np.array([[0], [1], [2], [3]])
y_train = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
# Query point
X_test = np.array([[1.5]])

# Create and train the classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Predict the label of X_test
print(knn.predict(X_test))  # Outputs [1]
```

This code produces the same result: the query at 1.5 is classified as class 1. The `KNeighborsClassifier` handles all distance computation and voting internally.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of KNN

**Advantages:** KNN is remarkably simple and intuitive. It has **no training step** – it just stores the data – so training time is essentially zero. This makes it easy to update: adding new training examples simply means adding them to the dataset. KNN has very few hyperparameters (mainly *k* and the distance metric) and can handle both classification and regression. It also makes no assumption about the form of the decision boundary or data distribution (non-parametric), so it can model complex patterns given enough data. For small, low-dimensional datasets where interpretability matters, KNN can be an effective baseline.

**Disadvantages:** There are important downsides.  At prediction time, KNN must compute the distance from the query to every training point (an \$O(N)\$ operation per query), so it can be **slow and memory-intensive** for large datasets. It also **suffers in high-dimensional spaces**: as the number of features grows, distances between points become less meaningful (the “curse of dimensionality”). In high dimensions, all points tend to be nearly equidistant, so KNN’s notion of “nearest” breaks down.  KNN is also sensitive to **feature scaling**: if one feature has a much larger range than others, it will dominate the distance unless data are normalized.  Noisy or irrelevant features can degrade accuracy.  Moreover, KNN can be easily influenced by class imbalance or outliers. Finally, choosing *k* requires care: a very small *k* makes the model sensitive to noise, while a very large *k* smooths out distinctions.

**When to use KNN:** KNN is best when the dataset is **moderately sized** and the number of features is not too large. It is a good choice for a quick baseline or when model interpretability (the idea of “neighbors”) is desired.  Because it memorizes data, KNN works well when similar cases are expected to have the same label and when fast training is needed.  However, for very large datasets, very high-dimensional data, or when prediction speed is critical, more scalable models (like tree-based or linear models) may be preferable.

In summary, KNN is a fundamental, straightforward algorithm: it **learns by remembering** and **predicts by analogy**. It offers clear intuition at the cost of computational efficiency, and it highlights the trade-offs of model complexity in machine learning.
