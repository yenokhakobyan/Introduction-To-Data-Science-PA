## General NumPy functions (linked with linear algebra)
1. If `A` has shape `(2, 3)` and `B` has shape `(3, 2)`, what is the shape of `A.dot(B)`?  
   - A) `(2, 2)`  
   - B) `(3, 3)`  
   - C) `(2, 3)`  
   - D) `(3, 2)`  
   **Answer**: A (2, 2)  
   **Explanation**: Matrix multiplication of a (2×3) by (3×2) matrix yields a (2×2) result.

2. What does the following code print?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
   B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
   print(A.dot(B))
   ```  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[19 22]
    [43 50]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: This performs matrix multiplication. For example, the (0,0) entry is 1*5 + 2*7 = 19, and so on, yielding `[[19, 22], [43, 50]]`.

3. What does the following code print?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   A = np.ones((2, 3))
   v = np.array([1, 2, 3])
   print(A + v)
   ```  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[2. 3. 4.]
    [2. 3. 4.]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: `v` has shape (3,) and is broadcast across each row of `A` (shape (2,3)). Each row [1,1,1] plus [1,2,3] yields [2,3,4].

4. What is the result of the following code?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   v = np.array([3, 4])
   print(np.dot(v, v))
   ```  
   **Answer**: `25`  
   **Explanation**: The dot product of `[3, 4]` with itself is 3*3 + 4*4 = 25.

5. What is the result of the following code?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   v = np.array([3, 4])
   print(np.linalg.norm(v))
   ```  
   **Answer**: `5.0`  
   **Explanation**: The Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of [3, 4] is `sqrt(3^2 + 4^2)` = 5.0.

6. What does the following code return?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   A = np.array([[3, 1], [1, 2]])
   b = np.array([9, 8])
   x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
   print(x)
   ```  
   **Answer**: `[2. 3.]`  
   **Explanation**: It solves the linear system A·x = b. Here x = [2, 3] satisfies [3*2 + 1*3 = 9, 1*2 + 2*3 = 8].

7. Given:  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   arr = np.arange(27).reshape(3, 3, 3)
   arr2 = arr[..., 1]
   print(arr2.shape)
   ```  
   What is printed?  
   **Answer**: `(3, 3)`  
   **Explanation**: `arr` has shape (3,3,3). The slice `arr[..., 1]` picks index 1 along the last axis (e.g., the “second channel”), resulting in a (3,3) array.

8. Given:  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   x = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
   print(x[:, None].shape)
   ```  
   What is printed?  
   **Answer**: `(2, 1, 3)`  
   **Explanation**: `x[:, None]` adds a new axis (dimension) in the middle. The original shape (2,3) becomes (2,1,3).

9. What does the following code print?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
   print(A * A)
   print(A @ A)
   ```  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[ 1  4]
    [ 9 16]]
   [[ 7 10]
    [15 22]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: `A * A` is element-wise multiplication (squaring each entry of A). `A @ A` is matrix multiplication. For example, 1*1=1, 2*2=4, etc., versus the matrix product [[7,10],[15,22]].

10. What does this code print?  
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    M = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                  [4, 5, 6]])
    print(M[:, [0, 2]])
    ```  
    **Answer**:
    ```
    [[1 3]
     [4 6]]
    ```  
    **Explanation**: `M[:, [0, 2]]` selects columns 0 and 2 of each row. So from each row [1,2,3] and [4,5,6], it picks [1,3] and [4,6].

## NumPy for image processing
1. What does the following code do?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 4, 3)
   R = img[:, :, 0]
   print(R)
   ```  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[ 0  3  6  9]
    [12 15 18 21]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: This selects the first channel (red) of each pixel in the 2×4 image. The resulting array is the red channel values of each pixel.

2. Given:  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img = np.array([[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],
                   [[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]])
   gray = img.mean(axis=2)
   print(gray)
   ```  
   What is printed?  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[ 2.  5.]
    [ 8. 11.]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: Averaging the RGB channels yields a grayscale image. For example, (1+2+3)/3=2, (4+5+6)/3=5, etc.

3. What does this code print?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img = np.array([[0, 1, 2],
                   [3, 4, 5]])
   flipped = np.fliplr(img)
   print(flipped)
   ```  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[2 1 0]
    [5 4 3]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: `np.fliplr` flips the array horizontally (left-right).

4. What are the shape and content of the following cropped image?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img = np.arange(100).reshape(10, 10)
   crop = img[2:5, 3:8]
   print(crop.shape)
   print(crop)
   ```  
   **Answer**: `crop.shape` is `(3, 5)`, and `crop` is:
   ```
   [[23 24 25 26 27]
    [33 34 35 36 37]
    [43 44 45 46 47]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: This takes rows 2–4 and columns 3–7 (zero-indexed) from the 10×10 image, resulting in a 3×5 block.

5. What does this code output?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img = np.array([0, 127, 255], dtype=np.uint8)
   norm = img / 255
   print(norm)
   ```  
   **Answer**: `[0.         0.49803922 1.        ]`  
   **Explanation**: Dividing by 255 scales pixel values from [0,255] to the [0,1] range (normalization).

6. **Question**: If `img` is an RGB image with shape `(H, W, 3)`, what does `img[..., ::-1]` do?  
   - A) Flip the image horizontally  
   - B) Flip the image vertically  
   - C) Reverse the color channels (e.g., RGB to BGR)  
   - D) Convert the image to grayscale  
   **Answer**: C  
   **Explanation**: The `[::-1]` slice on the last axis reverses the order of color channels (swapping R and B).

7. Consider two 2×2 grayscale images:  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img1 = np.zeros((2, 2))
   img2 = np.ones((2, 2))
   combined = np.stack([img1, img2], axis=2)
   print(combined.shape)
   ```  
   What is printed?  
   **Answer**: `(2, 2, 2)`  
   **Explanation**: `np.stack` with `axis=2` creates a new third dimension. It stacks the two 2×2 images into a (2,2,2) array.

8. What is the shape of the transposed image?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img = np.arange(12).reshape(2, 3, 2)
   transposed = img.transpose(1, 0, 2)
   print(transposed.shape)
   ```  
   **Answer**: `(3, 2, 2)`  
   **Explanation**: Transposing with axes (1,0,2) swaps the first two dimensions. The image dimensions (2,3) become (3,2).

9. What does this code print?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   img = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
   print(np.flipud(img))
   ```  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[3 4]
    [1 2]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: `np.flipud` flips the array vertically (up-down).

10. What does this code print (applying a 2×2 mean filter)?  
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    img = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    filtered = (img[:-1, :-1] + img[:-1, 1:] + img[1:, :-1] + img[1:, 1:]) / 4
    print(filtered)
    ```  
    **Answer**:
    ```
    [[ 2.5  3.5  4.5]
     [ 6.5  7.5  8.5]
     [10.5 11.5 12.5]]
    ```  
    **Explanation**: Each element in `filtered` is the average of a 2×2 block of `img`. For example, the top-left is (0+1+4+5)/4 = 2.5.

## NumPy for text processing
1. What does this code output?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   arr = np.array(list("12345"), dtype=int)
   print(arr)
   ```  
   **Answer**: `[1 2 3 4 5]`  
   **Explanation**: Converting each character '1','2',... to an integer yields the numeric array [1,2,3,4,5].

2. Given:  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   vocab = {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
   text = ['a', 'c', 'b']
   indices = np.array([vocab[ch] for ch in text])
   onehot = np.eye(3, dtype=int)[indices]
   print(onehot)
   ```  
   What is printed?  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[1 0 0]
    [0 0 1]
    [0 1 0]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: Each row is a one-hot vector for 'a', 'c', 'b' respectively. 'a'→[1,0,0], 'c'→[0,0,1], 'b'→[0,1,0].

3. What is the result of the following padding?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   seq = np.array([1, 2, 3])
   padded = np.pad(seq, (0, 2), 'constant')
   print(padded)
   ```  
   **Answer**: `[1 2 3 0 0]`  
   **Explanation**: `np.pad` with `(0,2)` adds two zeros at the end of the sequence.

4. What does this code print?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   seq = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
   print(seq[1:4])
   ```  
   **Answer**: `[20 30 40]`  
   **Explanation**: `seq[1:4]` returns elements at indices 1, 2, and 3.

5. Given a sequence of token indices:  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   words = np.array([0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1])
   counts = np.bincount(words, minlength=3)
   print(counts)
   ```  
   What is printed?  
   **Answer**: `[2 3 1]`  
   **Explanation**: Token 0 appears twice, token 1 appears three times, token 2 appears once.

6. Consider consecutive word pairs:  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   words = np.array([0, 1, 0, 2])
   cooc = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)
   for i in range(len(words)-1):
       cooc[words[i], words[i+1]] += 1
   print(cooc)
   ```  
   What is printed?  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[0 1 1]
    [1 0 0]
    [0 0 0]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: `cooc[i,j]` counts transitions from word i to j. The transitions here are 0→1, 1→0, and 0→2, each occurring once.

7. What does this code output?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   embedding = np.arange(12).reshape(4, 3)
   seq = [3, 1, 2]
   embedded_seq = embedding[seq]
   print(embedded_seq)
   ```  
   **Answer**:
   ```
   [[ 9 10 11]
    [ 3  4  5]
    [ 6  7  8]]
   ```  
   **Explanation**: `embedding` is a 4×3 matrix (rows 0–3). Indexing with [3,1,2] selects rows 3, 1, and 2 in that order.

8. What does this code print?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   words = np.array(['Hello', 'World'])
   print(np.char.lower(words))
   ```  
   **Answer**: `['hello' 'world']`  
   **Explanation**: `np.char.lower` applies the lowercase operation to each string in the array.

9. What is the output of this code?  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   text = "banana"
   chars = np.array(list(text))
   unique_chars = np.unique(chars)
   print(unique_chars)
   ```  
   **Answer**: `['a' 'b' 'n']`  
   **Explanation**: `np.unique` returns sorted unique characters from the array (here 'a', 'b', 'n').

10. If you create a one-hot encoding for a sequence of length 3 from a vocabulary of size 5, what is the shape of the resulting array?  
    - A) `(3,)`  
    - B) `(5, 3)`  
    - C) `(3, 5)`  
    - D) `(5,)`  
    **Answer**: C (3, 5)  
    **Explanation**: Each of the 3 tokens is represented by a 5-dimensional one-hot vector, giving a (3,5) array (3 rows, one per token).
